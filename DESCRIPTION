Description: Computes confidence intervals for binomial or Poisson rates and
    their differences or ratios. Including the rate (or risk)
    difference ('RD') or rate ratio (or relative risk, 'RR') for binomial
    proportions or Poisson rates, and odds ratio ('OR', binomial only).
    Also confidence intervals for RD, RR or OR for paired binomial data, 
    and estimation of a proportion from clustered binomial data.  
    Includes skewness-corrected asymptotic score ('SCAS') methods, 
    which have been developed in Laud (2017) <doi:10.1002/pst.1813> 
    from Miettinen and Nurminen (1985) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780040211> 
    and Gart and Nam (1988) <doi:10.2307/2531848>, and in 
    Laud (2025, under review) for paired proportions. The same score produces 
    hypothesis tests that are improved versions of the non-inferiority test 
    for binomial RD and RR by Farrington and Manning (1990) 
    <doi:10.1002/sim.4780091208>, or a generalisation of the McNemar test for 
    paired data. The package also includes MOVER methods (Method Of Variance
    Estimates Recovery) for all contrasts, derived from the Newcombe
    method but with options to use equal-tailed intervals in place of the
    Wilson score method, and generalised for Bayesian applications
    incorporating prior information. So-called 'exact' methods for
    strictly conservative coverage are approximated using continuity
    adjustments, and the amount of adjustment can be selected to avoid
    over-conservative coverage.  Also includes methods for stratified
    calculations (e.g. meta-analysis), either with fixed effect assumption
    (matching the CMH test) or incorporating stratum heterogeneity.
